VPC has 4 steps
1 Create a VPC
2 Create Subnet
3 Internet Gateway
4 Route Tables
CIDR- Classless Inter Dpmain Routing
Subnet is VPC
VPC- Virtual Private Cloud
So whenever we create a VPC automatically DHCP, NACL & SECURITY GRP will be created with the VPC.
VPC is always created in a region not created in AZ.
